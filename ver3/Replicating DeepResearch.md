> When writing code to create local applications using LLMs, some of them like ChatGPT and Gemini have the ability to ground their generations in online search results. I need to make a project that replicates this functionality using Claude and DuckDuckGo, using LangGraph if needed. Look into SERP queries and put that into context with this, scouring the web with searches, thinking, and follow up searches to reach a decent level of complexity, and making sure to cite all the sources. My goal is to ultimately create a DeepResearch clone. 

To help you replicate ChatGPT and Gemini's grounded generation capabilities using Claude and DuckDuckGo, could you please clarify the following:

1. What programming language(s) or framework are you using (e.g., Python, Node.js)?
2. Are you aiming to use Claude via API, local LLM emulation, or Anthropic's hosted version?
3. Should the project be implemented as a CLI tool, web app, or another form of interface?
4. Are there specific research domains you want to prioritize (e.g., scientific, technical, financial)?
5. Should the citations and web results be shown inline or at the end of a response?

Once I have this information, I can dive into the technical design and provide concrete implementation guidance.

> Here are my answers:
> 1. I will be using Python, with LangGraph.
> 2. I have access to some Claude models hosted on AWS Bedrock, and can make calls to them through a service called ProxyLLM, which ultimately boils down to simple calls such as p_llm.invoke(prompt) and then I get returned the output.
> 3. The project can be implemented on a Gradio UI interface. If that will make things too complicated, feel free to begin with a CLI tool, which generates markdown and can be rendered as such,  and then we can add the Gradio interface later.
> 4. Focus on financial domains like SEC Edgar, Yahoo Finance, Crunchbase, etc. but also look through any sources where content is available, of course. Sometimes useful information may be present on different sites. But as this tool will primarily be used to generate financial reports and pitchbook slides for bankers, a slightly stronger focus on financial domains would work.
> 5. Whichever's preferable or easier. Like the numerical references can be shown inline and then the full links with the corresponding numbers as a list at the end.

Thanks for the detailed answers. I’ll begin researching how to replicate grounded generation functionality (like ChatGPT and Gemini) using Claude (via ProxyLLM) and DuckDuckGo, with LangGraph as the orchestration framework. This includes building a CLI tool (for now) that can conduct complex search-query chains across finance-focused and general sources, integrate Claude model reasoning, and return citation-rich markdown-formatted responses similar to DeepResearch.

I’ll let you know once I have a detailed breakdown with relevant citations and architecture recommendations.

# Introduction

Recent AI “deep research” features (e.g. ChatGPT’s Deep Research [[openai](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#:~:text=Deep%20research%20is%20OpenAI%27s%20next,reaction%20to%20information%20it%20encounters)] and Anthropic’s Claude web-search mode [[anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20use%20Claude,from%20the%20most%20recent%20data)]) illustrate how LLMs can autonomously browse the web and cite sources.  We aim to replicate this locally: given a query, the tool will generate appropriate web searches (via DuckDuckGo), retrieve relevant documents, and prompt Claude to synthesize an answer with inline citations.  This involves building a pipeline of search tools, scrapers, and LLM prompts, orchestrated by a LangGraph-based workflow.

# Search Query Generation and DuckDuckGo

The first step is to convert the user’s query into effective search terms.  Best practice is to craft focused queries (using keywords, Boolean operators, site-specific filters, etc.) that target relevant data.  For example, DuckDuckGo supports advanced operators like `site:`, `intitle:`, `filetype:` and exclusion (`-`) [[duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/#:~:text=,cats)]. One might query `Apple Q4 2023 revenue site:apple.com` or `“annual report” Apple 2023 filetype:pdf`.  A Python tool such as the **duckduckgo-search** library (v8.0.2, May 2025) can automate this: it provides a simple interface to get URLs from DuckDuckGo [[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search/#:~:text=duckduckgo)].  For instance, using `duckduckgo-search` one can retrieve the top N links for a query without dealing with HTML parsing directly.

Alternate approaches include paid SERP APIs (e.g. SerpApi), which offer a DuckDuckGo endpoint with JSON output [[serpapi](https://serpapi.com/duckduckgo-search-api#:~:text=Our%20DuckDuckGo%20API%20allows%20you,search%3Fengine%3Dduckduckgo)].  We should always throttle queries (insert delays of 1–2 seconds or use an async queue) and rotate user-agent headers to avoid blocks.  A best practice is to check **robots.txt** rules before scraping any domain. Python’s `urllib.robotparser` module can parse a site’s `robots.txt` and determine crawl-delay and allowed paths [[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.robotparser.html#:~:text=This%20module%20provides%20a%20single,files%2C%20see%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.robotstxt.org%2Forig.html)].  

Once results are fetched, parse the SERP to extract links, titles, and snippets.  This can be done with the DuckDuckGo library’s output or by custom HTML parsing.  Store these URLs to visit next.  (In a LangGraph flow, one node might handle “search”, outputting a list of link records for downstream nodes.) 

# Content Retrieval and Scraping

For each retrieved link, fetch the page content. Use `requests` (or `httpx`) with appropriate headers and respect `robots.txt`.  After downloading, extract the main text. Common strategies include using BeautifulSoup or **trafilatura/newspaper3k** to strip boilerplate and get article paragraphs.  For PDFs (common in SEC filings and reports), use a PDF parser (e.g. PyMuPDF or pdfminer) to extract text.  Always abide by site terms; for high-value sources, prefer official APIs if available.

- **SEC Filings:** Instead of scraping HTML, use the [SEC EDGAR API](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/) or helper libraries. For example, the `sec-edgar-downloader` Python package can download filings by ticker or CIK [[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sec-edgar-downloader/#:~:text=sec,cannot%20find%20an%20appropriate%20ticker)]. It respects SEC’s fair-use policy and automates the URL construction. This is preferable to scraping the SEC site, which may be blocked.  
- **Yahoo Finance:** Use the **yfinance** library to retrieve stock prices, company profiles, and news summaries [[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/#:~:text=yfinance%20offers%20a%20Pythonic%20way,market%20data%20from%20Yahoo%21%E2%93%87%20finance)]. yfinance uses Yahoo’s unofficial APIs for market data and is free for research use. It avoids HTML parsing of Yahoo pages entirely.  
- **Crunchbase:** Crunchbase offers an official REST API (v4.0) for approved users [[data](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api#:~:text=Build%20powerful%20applications%20and%20integrate,com)]. If API access is available, use it to query company data (funding rounds, valuations, etc.). If not, rely on web search results or third-party aggregators; scraping Crunchbase without permission is generally not allowed.  

For general web content, after fetching a page, sanitize and summarize it. You can break pages into passages or sections. Each passage will later be fed to the LLM as context. It’s often useful to keep the original URL and scrape date with each snippet to cite properly.  

# LangGraph Workflow Design

LangGraph (built on LangChain) lets us define a **stateful graph** of steps (nodes) and transitions (edges) [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20a%20library%20that,and%20defining%20complex%20decision%20flows)] [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20built%20around%3A)].  We design nodes for: query-generation, web-search, content-scrape, LLM-analysis, and answer-generation. Edges control the flow (including loops for multi-turn reasoning). For example:

- **Start Node:** Takes the user query from the CLI input.  
- **Query Node:** A LangGraph node that formats or refines the query (could call Claude to rephrase if needed) and sends it to the search tool.  
- **Search Node:** Calls DuckDuckGo (via `duckduckgo-search` or `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` from LangChain Community) to get links.  
- **Scrape Node(s):** For each link, fetch content (using `requests`+`BeautifulSoup` or PDF parser). Aggregate or filter passages that seem relevant (e.g. paragraphs containing query keywords).  
- **LLM Node (assistant):** Invokes Claude (via `p_llm.invoke(prompt)`) with the question and gathered text. It can perform analysis like answering the question, suggesting follow-up queries, or evaluating source quality.  
- **Decision/Loop Nodes:** Based on Claude’s output, LangGraph can decide to continue searching (if sources were insufficient) or to end. For instance, a node could check if the answer is confident or if more data is needed, and loop back to search with a refined query (multi-hop).  
- **End Node:** Produces the final answer.

LangGraph’s **conditional routing** allows dynamic flows. For example, if Claude says “I’m not sure” or “insufficient info,” the graph can branch to a “refine search” subgraph [[blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph/#:~:text=down%20in%20cases%20when%20the,that%20may%20not%20be%20predefined)]. In practice, one might implement a loop where Claude generates a follow-up question or new search terms, the tool runs that, and Claude is invoked again on the new data. This resembles LangChain’s ReAct or self-asking prompting, formalized in the graph. [[blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph/#:~:text=down%20in%20cases%20when%20the,that%20may%20not%20be%20predefined)] [[github](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher#:~:text=Architecture)] Nodes share a **state** object (e.g. collected sources, interim answers) which guides decisions [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20built%20around%3A)]. 

LangGraph also supports visualization (e.g. Mermaid diagrams) to debug this workflow. For instance, a sample LangGraph for a financial chatbot had nodes **Start**, **Assistant**, **Tools**, and **End**, with edges representing either direct reply or tool calls [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=,the%20completion%20of%20the%20interaction)]. In that example, the *Assistant* node evaluated whether to execute a tool (fetch stock price or web info) based on the query, illustrating how LangGraph integrates LLM “thought” and tools.

# Claude Grounded Answering

With content in hand, we prompt Claude to answer. The prompt should instruct Claude to **use the provided text excerpts** when forming the answer and to generate inline citations. For example, we might input:
```
User Q: "What was Apple’s revenue in fiscal Q4 2023?"
Context: "Apple today announced financial results for fiscal Q4 2023... The Company posted quarterly revenue of $89.5 billion..." [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)] 
Task: Answer citing sources.
```
Claude’s response would then incorporate the quoted fact and attach the source reference, e.g. *“Apple reported fiscal Q4 2023 revenue of $89.5 billion [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)].”* 

By supplying the exact snippet (as above from Apple’s press release [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)]), we ground Claude’s answer. This mirrors ChatGPT’s approach: Claude’s new web-search mode “provides direct citations” when using web data [[anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20use%20Claude,from%20the%20most%20recent%20data)]. We emulate this by forcing the answer to reflect the text we feed it. In the final markdown output, we include numeric citations like this one, linking to our collected sources. 

**Example:** Suppose the agent fetches Apple’s Q4 2023 results. It might extract *“The Company posted quarterly revenue of $89.5 billion” [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)]*. We then prompt Claude: *“According to the Apple press release (excerpt above), what was the quarterly revenue?”* Claude outputs: *“Apple’s Q4 2023 revenue was \$89.5 billion [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)].”* In our report, we format this answer with the citation.

# Multi-step and Multi-hop Reasoning

Complex queries often require *multi-hop* research. For example, answering “Which startup founded in 2020 with a Series C over \$500M?” might require separate queries (startup list, funding info) and combining answers. LangGraph’s graph can orchestrate this: one node (planner) could instruct multiple sub-queries, while downstream nodes (executors) gather each piece.  This is similar to the “planner” and “execution” agents in research agents like GPT-Researcher [[github](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher#:~:text=Architecture)]: the planner breaks the task into questions, execution nodes fetch answers, and a final node aggregates. 

OpenAI describes its Deep Research feature as *“leveraging reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text... pivoting as needed”* [[openai](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#:~:text=Deep%20research%20is%20OpenAI%27s%20next,reaction%20to%20information%20it%20encounters)]. In practice, this means our LLM can refine searches on-the-fly. For instance, if Claude sees conflicting numbers, the workflow could branch to verify each number from authoritative sources. This looped, agentic behavior is exactly what LangGraph supports via its cyclical graph structure [[blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph/#:~:text=down%20in%20cases%20when%20the,that%20may%20not%20be%20predefined)] [[openai](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#:~:text=Deep%20research%20is%20OpenAI%27s%20next,reaction%20to%20information%20it%20encounters)]. We may implement “stop” conditions (e.g. no new info, or max hops reached) to prevent infinite loops.

# Tooling and Frameworks

Key libraries and tools include:

- **duckduckgo-search (PyPI)** – Python package for DuckDuckGo web queries [[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search/#:~:text=duckduckgo)]. Provides search results (titles, links, snippets) without manual scraping.  
- **LangGraph (LangChain extension)** – Graph-based workflow orchestrator for LLM agents [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20a%20library%20that,and%20defining%20complex%20decision%20flows)] [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20built%20around%3A)]. Allows defining nodes (LLM calls, tools, decision logic) and edges (flow control) with maintained state.  
- **LangChain** – Core framework for LLM tooling. We use LangChain to wrap Claude (via ProxyLLM) and integrate tools. LangGraph is built on LangChain [[medium](https://medium.com/@noorfatimaafzalbutt/langgraph-streamlining-workflow-design-with-graph-based-ai-applications-6ecefc2c437f#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20an%20extension%20of,or%20control%20between%20these%20tasks)] [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20a%20library%20that,and%20defining%20complex%20decision%20flows)].  
- **yfinance (Python)** – Yahoo Finance API wrapper for market and company data [[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/#:~:text=yfinance%20offers%20a%20Pythonic%20way,market%20data%20from%20Yahoo%21%E2%93%87%20finance)]. Can fetch stock prices, financial statements, and news feeds, avoiding scraping Yahoo’s website.  
- **requests + BeautifulSoup / trafilatura** – Standard web-scraping libraries for HTTP GET and HTML parsing. For example, `requests.get(url)` + `BeautifulSoup(page, "lxml")` to extract text. Trafilatura or Newspaper3K can also extract article text automatically (often used in RAG pipelines).  
- **urllib.robotparser (Python)** – Standard library class to read and obey `robots.txt` rules [[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.robotparser.html#:~:text=This%20module%20provides%20a%20single,files%2C%20see%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.robotstxt.org%2Forig.html)]. Use it to pause or skip requests disallowed by crawling rules.  
- **SerpApi (optional)** – A paid search API that can fetch DuckDuckGo SERPs as JSON [[serpapi](https://serpapi.com/duckduckgo-search-api#:~:text=Our%20DuckDuckGo%20API%20allows%20you,search%3Fengine%3Dduckduckgo)]. Useful if higher reliability is needed, though not free.

# Example Workflow

Consider a query like **“What was the revenue of Company X in 2022?”**. A possible LangGraph execution might be:

1. **Generate search query:** LLM reformulates (if needed) to “Company X 2022 revenue report”.  
2. **Search:** DuckDuckGo returns e.g. the company’s annual report link and news articles.  
3. **Scrape:** Fetch the annual report (a PDF or webpage). Use a PDF parser or HTML parser to extract the relevant statement (“revenue: $Y billion”).  
4. **Analyze:** Prompt Claude with the question and the extracted excerpt. Claude answers: *“Company X’s 2022 revenue was $Y billion【source】.”*  
5. **Cite:** The answer includes a citation to the URL/text from step 3.  

If the first report was incomplete, LangGraph could loop: Claude’s output triggers a follow-up search (“Company X 2022 financial statement”) to find another source, then rerun steps 3–4.

# Conclusion

By combining **DuckDuckGo search**, **web scraping**, and a **Claude** LLM in a LangGraph-managed flow, we can mimic ChatGPT’s grounded answering. Key best practices include crafting targeted queries (using `site:`/operators [[duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/#:~:text=,cats)]), obeying robots.txt and rate limits [[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.robotparser.html#:~:text=This%20module%20provides%20a%20single,files%2C%20see%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.robotstxt.org%2Forig.html)], and leveraging specialized data sources (yfinance, SEC APIs). LangGraph’s flexible, stateful graphs allow conditional loops for iterative reasoning [[medium](https://medium.com/@dbresciani99/inside-my-analyst-style-ai-chatbot-tool-integration-with-langgraph-bf490da5f2c0#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20a%20library%20that,and%20defining%20complex%20decision%20flows)] [[blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph/#:~:text=down%20in%20cases%20when%20the,that%20may%20not%20be%20predefined)]. In each step, we ground answers by feeding source excerpts to Claude and formatting its response with inline citations. This yields answers like:

> *“According to the official report, Apple’s fiscal Q4 2023 revenue was $89.5 billion [[apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%20Apple%20today%20announced,13%20percent%20year%20over%20year)].”*

> I only have access to Claude 3.5 models, so native searching will not work. But besides that, your plan sounds good. Can you provide a starter code file with all the necessary components? Include the LangGraph state, all of the required prompts with placeholder texts (so that it doesn't become too long), the LangGraph flow with nodes, tools, and edges, and then a final execution. Make sure that you consider where to accept user input in the graph, entrypoints and exitpoints.

I’ve scaffolded a Python starter file that:

- Defines tools for DuckDuckGo search and web scraping  
- Wraps Claude (via `p_llm.invoke`) as a LangGraph tool  
- Provides placeholder prompt templates for query refinement and synthesis  
- Constructs a LangGraph with entry/exit nodes, tool calls, and state passing  
- Includes a `run_deepresearch()` entrypoint that accepts user input and prints a markdown-formatted answer

You can iterate on prompt templates, extend scraping (e.g. PDF parsing), add throttling/robots.txt checks, or swap in a Gradio UI by replacing the `run_deepresearch()` function. Let me know if you’d like adjustments or to integrate Gradio next!

> Please integrate Gradio into this next!

Gradio is now fully integrated. The interface:

- Accepts a research question from the user
- Triggers the LangGraph workflow with DuckDuckGo + scraping + Claude
- Returns a synthesized markdown answer with inline citations

You can launch it by running the script normally (`python your_script.py`). Let me know if you’d like to:

- Customize the UI (e.g. dropdowns for financial domains)
- Add PDF/Excel ingestion or citation formatting
- Integrate document uploads for RAG-style workflows

Would you like to style it like a research terminal or keep the clean Gradio UI for now?
